## Introduction

Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews test your ability to:
- Design maintainable, extensible systems
- Apply OOP principles and design patterns
- Make informed trade-off decisions
- Write clean, production-ready code

**Duration:** Typically 45-60 minutes  
**Format:** Coding on whiteboard/shared editor  
**Focus:** Code structure, not algorithms

---

## Interview Format

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (5-10 mins)
- **Don't jump to coding immediately!**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Confirm assumptions with interviewer

### Phase 2: Design Discussion (15-20 mins)
- Identify core entities (classes)
- Define relationships between entities
- Discuss design patterns to use
- Draw rough class diagram (optional)

### Phase 3: Implementation (20-25 mins)
- Start with core classes
- Define interfaces first
- Implement key methods
- Show extensibility

### Phase 4: Discussion & Extensions (5-10 mins)
- Discuss trade-offs
- Talk about scalability
- Suggest improvements
- Answer follow-up questions

---

## Step-by-Step Approach

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
**Questions to Ask:**
- "What are the core features needed?"
- "How many users/transactions do we expect?" (Scale)
- "Are there any specific constraints?"
- "Should we prioritize X over Y?"

**Example:** Design a Parking Lot
- "How many floors?"
- "Types of vehicles supported?"
- "Payment methods?"
- "Multiple entry/exit points?"

### Step 2: Identify Core Entities
**Technique:** Look for **nouns** in the problem statement

**Example:** Parking Lot
- ParkingLot, ParkingSpot, Vehicle, Ticket, Payment, Gate

**Tips:**
- Start with 5-7 core classes
- Don't over-engineer initially
- Focus on main flow first

### Step 3: Define Relationships
**Types:**
- **Association:** `Order` has a `Customer`
- **Composition:** `Car` has an `Engine` (strong ownership)
- **Inheritance:** `Car` extends `Vehicle`
- **Aggregation:** `Library` has `Books` (weak ownership)

### Step 4: Identify Design Patterns
**Common Patterns by Use Case:**

| Use Case | Pattern | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Need single instance | Singleton | ParkingLot, DBConnection |
| Varying object creation | Factory | Vehicle types |
| Complex construction | Builder | Car with many options |
| Varying algorithm | Strategy | Pricing, Sorting |
| Behavior changes with state | State | Order status, Ride status |
| Notify multiple objects | Observer | Order updates |
| Add functionality | Decorator | Pizza toppings |

### Step 5: Apply SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility:**
```java
// Bad
class User {
    void saveToDatabase() {
    }  // DB logic

    void sendEmail() {
    }       // Email logic
}

// Good
class User {
}

class UserRepository {
    void save(User user) {
    }
}

class EmailService {
    void send(User user) {
    }
}
```

**Open/Closed:**
```java
// Bad - need to modify for new payment types
class PaymentProcessor {
    void process(String type) {
        if (type.equals("credit")) { }
        else if (type.equals("debit")) { }
    }
}

// Good - extend without modifying
interface PaymentMethod {
    void process();
}
class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod { }
class DebitCardPayment implements PaymentMethod { }
```

### Step 6: Code Structure
```java
// Start with interfaces
interface PaymentMethod {
    boolean process(double amount);
}

// Core entities
class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private Customer customer;
    private OrderState state;
    // ... getters, setters
}

// Services
class OrderService {
    public Order placeOrder(Customer customer, List<Item> items) {
        // Business logic
    }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Jumping to Code
**Problem:** Start coding without understanding requirements  
**Solution:** Spend 5-10 mins discussing requirements first

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: God Classes
**Problem:** One class doing everything
```java
class Uber {
    void matchDriver() { }
    void calculateFare() { }
    void processPayment() { }
    void sendNotification() { }
    // 50 more methods...
}
```
**Solution:** Separate concerns into focused classes

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Ignoring Extensibility
**Problem:** Hardcoding everything
```java
double fare = 10 + distance * 2;  // What if pricing changes?
```
**Solution:** Use Strategy pattern
```java
interface PricingStrategy {
    double calculate(Ride ride);
}
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Over-Engineering
**Problem:** Using 10 design patterns for simple problem  
**Solution:** Start simple, add patterns only when needed

### ‚ùå Mistake 5: No Error Handling
**Problem:** Assuming happy path always
```java
void borrowBook(Member member, Book book) {
    // What if book is unavailable?
    // What if member has overdue books?
}
```
**Solution:** Handle edge cases

### ‚ùå Mistake 6: Poor Naming
**Problem:** `a`, `data`, `manager`, `handler` everywhere  
**Solution:** Use descriptive names - `OrderService`, `PaymentProcessor`
