# ðŸ”Œ Adapter Design Pattern

The **Adapter Design Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by
acting as a bridge between them. Itâ€™s like a power adapter that lets a US plug work with a European socket.

## âœ… Definition

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. It wraps an existing
class with an incompatible interface, enabling it to work with a system designed for a different interface.

- **Category**: Structural Pattern
- **Purpose**: Enable compatibility between classes with mismatched interfaces.

## ðŸ¤” Intuition

Imagine trying to charge your phone with a charger that doesnâ€™t fit the local power outlet. You use an adapter to bridge
the gap between the chargerâ€™s plug and the outlet. The Adapter Pattern works similarly: it wraps an incompatible class (
the adaptee) with an adapter that conforms to the expected interface, allowing seamless integration without modifying
the original class.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

The Adapter Pattern is ideal when:

- You need to integrate a legacy system or third-party library with an incompatible interface.
- You want to reuse an existing class without modifying its code.
- Multiple classes with different interfaces need to work with a common system.
- Examples:
    - **Legacy System Integration**: Adapting old database APIs to modern frameworks.
    - **API Wrappers**: Wrapping external APIs (e.g., payment gateways) to match your applicationâ€™s interface.
    - **GUI Components**: Adapting UI libraries to work with a specific framework.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

1. **Target Interface**:
    - The interface that the client expects and interacts with.

2. **Adapter**:
    - A class that implements the target interface and wraps the adaptee, translating calls to the adapteeâ€™s interface.

3. **Adaptee**:
    - The existing class with an incompatible interface that needs adaptation.

4. **Client**:
    - The code that uses the target interface, unaware of the adaptee or adapter.

5. **Object vs. Class Adapter**:
    - **Object Adapter**: Uses composition to hold the adaptee (more flexible).
    - **Class Adapter**: Uses inheritance to extend the adaptee (less common, requires multiple inheritance in some
      languages).

## ðŸŽ¯ Advantages & Disadvantages

#### Advantages

- Enables reuse of existing classes without modifying their code.
- Promotes loose coupling between client and adaptee.
- Flexible, as adapters can support multiple adaptees or formats.

#### Disadvantages

- Adds complexity with additional classes.
- May require multiple adapters for different adaptees.
- Performance overhead due to the extra layer of indirection.
