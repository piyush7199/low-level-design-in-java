- ✅ **Detailed code structures** with proper abstractions
- ✅ **Design patterns** for common problems
- ✅ **SOLID principles** for maintainability

**Why LLD matters in interviews:**
- 60% of system design interviews include LLD rounds
- Tests your ability to write clean, extensible code
- Demonstrates understanding of OOP and design patterns
- Shows real-world problem-solving skills

## 🔹 Design Patterns (Code)

### 🔨 Creational Design Patterns

| # | Pattern Name                                                                    | Description                                                                                                            |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [Singleton](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/creational/singleton)              | Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.                                       |
| 2 | [Builder](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/creational/builder)                  | Separates complex object construction from its representation.                                                         |
| 3 | [Factory](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/creational/factory)                  | Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic.                                                              |
| 4 | [Prototype](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/creational/prototype)              | Create new objects by copying existing ones, reducing the cost of creation.                                            |
| 5 | [Abstract Factory](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/creational/abstractFactory) | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. |

### 🧱 Structural Design Patterns

| # | Pattern Name                                                       | Description                                                                 |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [Decorator](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/structural/decorator) | Dynamically adds new behavior to objects at runtime.                        |
| 2 | [Flyweight](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/structural/flyweight) | Reduces memory usage by sharing common parts of object state among objects. |
| 3 | [Adapter](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/structural/adapter)     | Converts one interface into another expected by the client.                 |

### 🧠 Behavioural Design Patterns

| # | Pattern Name                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                        |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [Chain Of Responsibility](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/behavioural/chainOfResponsibility) | Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it.                                                           |
| 2 | [Observer](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/behavioural/observer)                             | Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. |
| 3 | [Strategy](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/behavioural/strategy)                             | Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime by encapsulating it within a class and making it interchangeable.             |
| 4 | [Command](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/behavioural/command)                               | Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing users to parameterize clients, delay execution, or queue and log operations. |
| 5 | [State](./src/main/java/org/lld/patterns/behavioural/state)                                   | Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it changed its class.                     |
